# PlatEngine

A simple tile based 2d platformer engine, project started 1/23/2023. Currently just made by myself with input from some friends. Unsure how far I'll go with this project.

It's a x64 application that uses SDL, SDL_image, SDL_ttf, may use SDL_mixer

Assets will be unavailable until I figure out how to use github better :)

Rough description of what each header file does will be found in source.cpp next upload, maybe with more comments at the beginning of files.
